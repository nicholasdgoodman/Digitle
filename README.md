## Simple guess the numbers game!

Day of coding with the kids to teach them the basics of HTML / JavaScript.

Inspired by Wordle, pick the right number by guessing digits 0-9. 

- Green means you got the right digit in the right place!
- Yellow means the digit is in the answer but in the wrong position!
- Red means the number is not in the answer at all!
